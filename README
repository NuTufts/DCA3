This is a simple DAQ script library for Mu2e CRV SiPM digitizer boards, also known as DAPHNE in SBND.
The DAQ consists primarily of two python3 scripts:
  takeBinaryData connects to a dapnne board over a socket network interface, and can direct the board to record a spill, can run board setup commands,
  and can read and save spill data as a binary file using the RDB command. Note that takeBinaryData does not work over a usb (serial) connection, as RDB
  is not supported over USB on most microcontroller versions.
  
  takeAndExportRoot analizes data from the .bin files imported by takeBinaryData. It is able to plot and histogram the waveforms, has basic functionality to
  filter by certain features, and can make FFT's. If ROOT python libraries are available, it also has basic functionality to export up to 4 channels as a ROOT
  TTree for external analysis.
  
  Many of the features of the CLI python scripts are made available in GUI form as DCA3.py. DCA3 simply calls the command line scripts with certain arguments when
  buttons are clicked, and additional arguments to the scripts can be injected by adding to the text fields.
  
  DCA2Live is an old python2 script that repeatedly takes a spill for one second, and then plots a sample of the waveforms from that spill. This can be useful in debugging.
